In the past year, I played a pivotal role in enhancing the CFDAM's migration to the CAT platform. Notably, I established a stable test environment for CFDAM, ensuring smooth Business-As-Usual operations. Simultaneously, I streamlined and error-proofed the Release process. On the CAT side, I contributed significantly by creating new reports (Poseidon, ESG) and guiding the team through Solace and Kong integration.

Moreover, my proactive approach extended to proposing valuable enhancements for the CAT Platform, specifically in Spark Joins and Database versioning. In my managerial capacity, I diligently oversaw the Bangalore Loanshub team, ensuring the completion of assigned tasks while providing mentorship. I assumed the role of Subject Matter Expert for Big Data on both CAT and CFDAM sides.

During a critical period when the sole Hive developer took an extended leave, I ensured continuity in project delivery by familiarizing the team with Hive's technicalities. Additionally, I played a crucial role in the hiring process in Bangalore, resulting in the acquisition of talented individuals.

Emphasizing the importance of coding standards, I actively participated in code reviews and design calls, contributing to the overall enhancement of the CAT platform. Through a dual focus on individual contributions and effective managerial oversight, I successfully navigated challenges and bolstered the Loanshub team's performance and project outcomes.

Delving deeper into the realm of Spark, I proactively identified and addressed hurdles in our Spark implementation, proposing design changes to optimize its functionality. My strategic vision extends to aligning Loanshub with a revamped Spark, geared towards facilitating on-the-fly computation and handling complex join operations more efficiently. This initiative reflects a commitment to enhancing the technical infrastructure and ensuring that Loanshub remains at the forefront of cutting-edge capabilities in the dynamic landscape of Spark technology.
