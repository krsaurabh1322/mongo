To add the checkpointing feature to your existing consumer classes with minimal changes and make it plug-and-play, you can follow an approach where you create a separate `CheckpointManager` class that handles checkpointing and provides a callback mechanism. This way, your existing consumer classes can use the `CheckpointManager` without needing significant modifications.

Here's how you can structure your code:

1. **CheckpointManager Class**:

   Create a `CheckpointManager` class that handles checkpoint creation, storage, and callback mechanism. This class will encapsulate the checkpointing logic and provide a clean interface for your consumers.

   ```java
   public class CheckpointManager {
       private MongoCollection<Document> checkpointCollection;
       private CheckpointCallback callback;

       public CheckpointManager(MongoCollection<Document> checkpointCollection, CheckpointCallback callback) {
           this.checkpointCollection = checkpointCollection;
           this.callback = callback;
       }

       public void createCheckpoint(String checkpointName, long eventId) {
           Document checkpoint = new Document("checkpointName", checkpointName)
                   .append("lastProcessedId", eventId);

           checkpointCollection.insertOne(checkpoint, (result, t) -> {
               if (t == null) {
                   // Checkpoint is successfully stored in MongoDB
                   // Trigger the checkpoint confirmation callback
                   callback.onCheckpointComplete();
               } else {
                   // Handle MongoDB error
               }
           });
       }
   }
   ```

2. **CheckpointCallback Interface**:

   Define a `CheckpointCallback` interface that your consumer classes will implement. This interface will specify the `onCheckpointComplete` method.

   ```java
   public interface CheckpointCallback {
       void onCheckpointComplete();
   }
   ```

3. **Consumer Class**:

   Modify your existing consumer classes to implement the `CheckpointCallback` interface. Inject the `CheckpointManager` into the consumer class. When an event is processed, call the `createCheckpoint` method, which will, in turn, trigger the callback when the checkpoint is complete.

   ```java
   public class YourConsumerClass implements CheckpointCallback {
       private CheckpointManager checkpointManager;

       public YourConsumerClass(MongoCollection<Document> checkpointCollection) {
           checkpointManager = new CheckpointManager(checkpointCollection, this);
       }

       public void consumeEvent(Event event) {
           // Process the event

           // Capture the event ID or other relevant data
           long eventId = extractEventId(event);

           // Perform checkpointing
           checkpointManager.createCheckpoint("solace_event", eventId);

           // Continue processing and respond to Solace
       }

       @Override
       public void onCheckpointComplete() {
           // This method will be called when the checkpoint is confirmed
           // You can proceed with sending the response to Solace or any other action.
       }
   }
   ```

This approach allows your existing consumer classes to remain mostly unchanged. You only need to implement the `CheckpointCallback` interface and inject the `CheckpointManager`. The `CheckpointManager` class encapsulates the checkpointing logic and makes it easy to integrate checkpointing into your existing consumers in a plug-and-play manner.
